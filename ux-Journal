Like many people in todayâ€™s day and age, I own a smartphone. I use a Samsung Galaxy s10+ running the Android operating system. The phone has many features 
but the one I will be referencing is its ability to review recorded videos. I recently decided to record a vlog. I got interrupted about halfway through 
and had to continue my thoughts on a separate recording. To remind myself where I left off with my talking points, I wanted to watch the last 60 seconds of 
my 10-minute video. When I opened up my gallery (in landscape mode), I found and tapped on the thumbnail of the video I wanted to watch. This started to play the video.

Near the bottom of the screen, on the thumbnail of the video, I saw a vertical, line shaped cursor moving to the right, illustrating the approximate 
percentage of the video that had played.  My intuition was to tap and drag that cursor to the right. What happened was the carousel of photos and videos moved 
along with my finger while the video stopped playing.
