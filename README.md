![alt text](assets/IMG_7531.jpg)

Hey Everybody! My name is Austin Devine. I'm an economics major minoring in computer science. I completed my capstone last semester and I am wrapping up my last two classes. In my free time, I enjoy performing improv, going bowling, and doing things with my fraternity, ΦΧΘ (Phi Chi Theta). I'm really looking forward to this class and getting to know all of you.
